Actionscript 3 Pong game
<br /><br />
Sorry for no menu. Game forces you to play as it starts. This is for educational purposes. <br/>
I didn't have much time. About 7 Hours, and in just one day. <br />
<br />
OOP code doesn't follow any design patterns or principles stated anywhere you might have read. <br />
This one was quick :D <br />
<br />
Controls: 
* Up Arrow - Move right Handle up
* Down Arrow - Move right Handle down
* W - Move left Handle up
* S - Move left Handle down
* Space - To continue after end of the turn (When th ball position is out of bounds on left and right edges)

<br />
Whoever gets 10 asap, WINS! :rage1:

<br />
And yeah, I couldn't lower the background music volume yet :rage4:
<br />
Thanks for stopping by!
